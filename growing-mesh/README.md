## Setup

The problem consists of a unit-square uniformly discretized by 768 x 768 nodes.
Running in parallel is only allowed for $n^2, \exists n \in \mathbb{N}$.
The unit square is partitioned equally among the ranks of a solver.

The mesh starts with 2 nodes in z direction and at a given frequency, 2 nodes are added to the mesh, changing only the load per rank, not the partitioning.

## Available solvers

There are two solvers that define the same mesh:

- A who runs first
- B who runs second

## Running the Simulation

Pass the amount of ranks to the run script of the solvers.
Not passing a number, runs the simulation on a single rank.
To run both on a two rank each, use:

```bash
cd A
./run.sh 2
```

and

```bash
cd B
./run.sh 2
```
